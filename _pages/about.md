You can call me Leo!

I am a researcher in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Audio, with a solid background in signal processing. Currently, I am a Junior Speech Researcher @CPqD working with Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and a Master’s candidate @UNICAMP.

## Interests
My research interests are aimed at developing audio‑based human‑machine interaction systems that are more affective and human‑empowering. Specifically, I work with text-to-speech systems, automatic speech recognition, voice and singing voice conversion, speech and music classification, music generation and neural audio effects. I am also a hobbyist music producer, composer, and multi‑instrumentalist. In addition, recently I have also focused on some Kaggle competitions.

  * **Tools**: Docker, Git
  * **Programming**: Python, C, C++, MATLAB, LaTeX
  * **Languages**: Portuguese, English, French
  * **Competences**: Paper Implementation, Experiment Design, Team Collaboration

## Work Experience
###(2023-Current) - Junior Speech Researcher @ CPqD
  * Improved the company’s emotion recognition system in production, in terms of speed and performance, by developing a 2‑step emotion recognition architecture (ECAPA‑TDNN to filter out neutral speech + WavLM Emotion Classifier).
  * Enriched the company’s call center customer profiling product by developing and sending to production speaker age+gender classifier models.
    
###(2021-2023) - Fellow Master @CPqD
  * Developed neural customer‑oriented expressive speech synthesis models for the Brazilian Portuguese language.
  * Enabled customers to edit the synthesized audios’ prosody in a fine‑grained way by implementing character‑level prosody control graph
pipelines on the ONNX version of the FastPitch TTS model.
  * Conducted several subjective perceptual experiments to evaluate synthetic audio quality and naturalness.
    
###(2020-2021) - Lab Internt @LPS
  * Enhanced lab automation by designing neural speech commands recognition systems.
  * Encapsulated the ASR system in a local private LoRa network for IoT purposes.
  * Enabled long distance voice control by developing a wearable prototype with an embedded microphone.
