Hello! 

You can call me Leo!

I am a researcher in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Audio, with a solid background in signal processing. Currently, I am a Junior Speech Researcher @CPqD working with Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and a Master’s candidate @UNICAMP.

My research interests are aimed at developing audio‑based human‑machine interaction systems that are more affective and human‑empowering. Specifically, I work with text-to-speech systems, automatic speech recognition, voice and singing voice conversion, speech and music classification, music generation and neural audio effects. I am also a hobbyist music producer, composer, and multi‑instrumentalist. In addition, recently I am also becoming a Kaggle competitor and surfer.

Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of studying at UNICAMP (State Univerity of Campinas), as a Master's student (currently), at Télécom Paris, as an exchange student and at UFPB (Federal University of Paraíba) as a graduation student. At the moment, my thesis concerns customer‑oriented expressive text‑to‑ speech systems for affective customer experience at CPqD for a variety of clients.
