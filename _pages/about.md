Hello! You can call me Leo!

I am a researcher in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Audio, with a solid background in signal processing. Currently, I am a Junior Speech Researcher @CPqD working with Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and a Master’s candidate @UNICAMP.

## Interests
My research interests are aimed at developing audio‑based human‑machine interaction systems that are more affective and human‑empowering. Specifically, I work with text-to-speech systems, automatic speech recognition, voice and singing voice conversion, speech and music classification, music generation and neural audio effects. I am also a hobbyist music producer, composer, and multi‑instrumentalist. In addition, recently I have also focused on some Kaggle competitions.
